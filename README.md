# IoT23-Malware-Detection
IoT (Internet of Things) is an emerging topic of interest among research and industrial fields which has proven to have a significant impact on human life by the integration with smart devices used in healthcare, home security, lifestyle, city dynamics, automobilism and many others.

Malware is a software designed to cause damage to a computer, server or network and jeopardize the safety of the user, company, infrastructure or even a whole population. Malwares have the potential of producing damages of around $15 billion USD (like in 2003) once they successfully attack.

IoT devices can be misused as infrastructure to botnets, being the mean for one of the largest DDoS attacks registered in the US where Mirai malware infected around 500,000 IoT devices in 164 countries and almost took down the entire internet in 2016. There is no doubt that malware in IoT represents a major problem due to the amount of devices connected today and tomorrow (estimated 125 billion by 2030). However, malware infections leave a trace in their network traffic, which makes them identifiable and predictable at some extent by analysing devicesâ€™ log files (basic principle of Security Information and event Management Systems). 

Even though safety protocols and security mechanisms are quite advanced, cyber attacks are getting more sophisticated and popular. In particular, to enhance the level of security in IoT devices, it is necessary to use specific methods, datasets and tools to develop SIEM Systems. Therefore, being able to develop deployable technology in the form of algorithms, frameworks or even programs, could be extremely useful to get a better  understanding of the behaviour of malware infections, IoT devices per se and their network traffic.
